          the Cardholder allows the Cardholder to make payments through Internet
          and that the Cardholder is the sole and exclusive owner of the OTP and
          accepts sole responsibility for use, confidentiality and protection of
          the OTP, as well as for all payments made using such OTP. The use of

          made from the Card other than by means of validation of the OTP sent
          by the Issuer.

          apportioned shall be eligible for conversion into EMI

          The EMI facility offered by IndusInd Bank shall be subject to levy of

          Due for that particular card.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once a Cardholder has opted for payment by EMI's, any subsequent
          change will attract a pre-closure charge of 3% on the Principal
          Outstanding of the loan. The pre-closure charges will be specified by
          IndusInd Bank from time to time. Any request for change in the EMI
          facility opted for has to be made in writing or by calling the 24 Hour

          billed to the Cardholder. If the Cardholder chooses not to pay the
          entire amount and opts to revolve, then the entire amount will accrue
          interest as per the schedule of charges.
        </li>

          instalments have been billed, the outstanding EMI Principal amount
          will be billed to the card account as one consolidated amount and
          interest charges as per schedule of charges will be applicable on such
          amount.
